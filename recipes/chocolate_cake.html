    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Most Amazing Chocolate Cake is full of moist, chocolatey perfection. This is the chocolate cake youâ€™ve been dreaming of! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter and flour for coating and dusting the cake pan</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups butter softened</li>
      <li>8 oz cream cheese softened</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>7-8 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>about 1/4 cup milk as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
      <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li>
      <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
      <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.</li>
      <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream Frosting</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results.</li>
      <li>Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.</li>
      <li>Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency. The frosting should be very thick and will thicken even more if refrigerated.</li>
    </ol>
